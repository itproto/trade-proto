Responsibility:
- init app
- mount/unmount MFE

MICRO-FRONT VS LAYERED
Feature based team: less friction, all work on the same
- web fragments

## Composition
- Server-side composition, for example with SSI, ESI, Tailor or Podium              
- Client-side composition, 
  - frames

# MicroFrontTeam
- With the micro frontends approach, teams are in full control of their technology stack (micro architecture).

- the application gets divided into multiple vertical slices that span from database to user interface.
- Being able to choose the technology thatâ€™s best for the job
